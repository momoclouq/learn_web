//What is OOP?
//method of programing that attempts to model some process or thing in the world as a class/object

//encapsulation
//data and processes on that data are owned by a class, other functions or classes outside should not be able to directly change/access the data

//inheritance
//when a child class inherits functionality from a parent class
//shares the some properties in common

//polymorphism
//does not work well in js?
//the idea that an instance of a child class can be trated as the parent class
